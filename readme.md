# Task Solver Program

## Description
This program allows users to:
1. Process numbers, names, and numeric arrays.
2. Check if a sequence is perfectly mirrored and corrects it if it's not.

In the second part of the task my assumption was that the sequence: [((())()(())]] 
is correct in case it follows a mirror pattern (left half should mirror the right half), 
so the answer should be no and the program will correct it in this case if it's even.


## How to Run
1. Go to the https://github.com/KitEA/eremenko-java-task/releases.
2. Download the `eremenko-java-task-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file.
3. Run the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   java -jar eremenko-java-task-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
